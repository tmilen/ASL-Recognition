This project is an **American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system** built using deep learning.  
It can recognize ASL hand signs in **real-time** using a webcam via **OpenCV** and a pre-trained Keras model.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Detects and recognizes ASL hand signs from live camera feed
- Uses a pre-trained deep learning model 
- Integrates **OpenCV** for real-time video capture
- Predicts letters from `A` to `Z`
